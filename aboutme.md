I'm a motivated and fastidious techie with 3 years IT-related experience, studying topics in computer networking and security while attending George Mason University for a Bachelors of Science in Information Systems. Looking to gain experience relevant to system administration, network security, and systems engineering.

### My story:

I have a eagerness to learn more about consumer technology, cyber security, programming, and computer networking. From a young age when I took apart my family computer (to a lot of protest) I knew I had found a passion that would stick with me for life. I built my first computer when I was 16-years-old, and ever since have been tinkering with technology for years. Whether its flashing lights with an Arduino or helping a friend repair their laptop. 

I want to further my professional experience, earn credentials, and begin building myself a lucrative and successful career in IT. But most importantly, I want to make a difference in the world. I want to help shape a better future with the use of technology. With a background in programming and IT Support, I believe my love of technology, desire to learn, adaptability, and leadership will provide me a clear path to this goal.
